Preface
-------
This plugin streams objects, pickups, checkpoints, race checkpoints,
map icons, and 3D text labels at user-defined server ticks. Basic
area detection is also included. Because it is written entirely in
C++, much of the overhead from PAWN is avoided. This streamer, as a
result, is quite a bit faster than any other implementation currently
available in PAWN.

Information
-----------
The Windows version is streamer.dll (you will need the Microsoft .NET
Framework 3.5 SP1 or higher), and the Linux version is streamer.so.

Instructions
------------
First, create a folder called plugins in your server directory if it
doesn't already exist. Place streamer.dll in it if you're using
Windows, or streamer.so if you're using Linux.

Add the following line to server.cfg so that the plugin will load the
next time the server starts: 

Windows:
plugins streamer

Linux:
plugins streamer.so

Next, put this in any filterscript or gamemode (it might be a good
idea to put it in your gamemode anyway since filterscripts can
sometimes conflict with one another):

#include <streamer>

That is it. Now simply add the plugin's natives and callbacks to your
script. Be very careful and look at the list above to ensure that you
are using them correctlydo not simply rename everything in your
script!

General Notes
-------------
- Default tickrate: 50
- Default maximum items: none (unlimited)
- Default visible items: 399 (objects); 2048 (pickups); 1024 (3D text
  labels)
- If -1 is specified for any of the optional parameters (worldid,
  interiorid, and playerid), the items will be streamed for all
  virtual worlds, interiors, and/or players.
- The tickrate does not represent any specific measurement of time
  and varies depending on the server's processing power. If items
  stream too slowly, lower the tickrate; if CPU usage gets too high,
  raise the tickrate.
- If some items are not appearing, there may be too many in one area.
  Limit the streaming distance by editing the last parameter on each
  native.
- Not all types of items have to be streamed. If the plugin is only
  used to stream objects, for example, then every other native can be
  safely ignored.
- Be careful when using streamed items with non-streamed items.
  Conflicts can sometimes arise.
- Ensure that all scripts are compiled with the latest include file.
  If the server outputs "Runtime error 19: 'File or function is not
  found'," then the gamemode is most likely compiled with an include
  file version that does not match the plugin version. 

Native Notes
------------
- Use Streamer_UpdateEx to preload items before setting a player's
  position or to stream items under OnPlayerRequestClass.
- Use the data manipulation natives like this (note the use of the
  defines and the enum above):

  Streamer_SetIntData(STREAMER_TYPE_OBJECT, gObject, E_STREAMER_MODEL_ID, 1225);

- To adjust an object's draw distance (added in SA-MP 0.3b), use
  Streamer_SetFloatData with E_STREAMER_DRAW_DISTANCE. The maximum
  draw distance is 300.0. Each object's default draw distance is 0.0.

Grid Notes
----------
- Use Streamer_CellDistance to adjust the area around which the
  plugin checks for nearby cells. Use Streamer_CellSize to adjust the
  size of each cell (this native rebuilds the grid, so use it only
  when necessary).
- It is recommended to make the cell distance a multiple of two in
  relation to the cell size. This prevents pop-in and ensures that
  all nearby cells are collected.
- The default cell distance is 400.0, and the default cell size is
  200.0. Unless there are any items with larger streaming distances
  than the default cell size, it is recommended to not increase these
  values for the best performance.
